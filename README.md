#  JavaScript Learning Journey — With PWA (Advanced Concepts)

This repository contains my complete **JavaScript learning progress**, built during classes and self-practice sessions while learning from **Ghous Ahmed**, and later exploring **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)** at an advanced level.

From basic syntax to advanced features, this repo represents my step-by-step learning path in mastering **JavaScript fundamentals**, **browser APIs**, and **modern web development concepts**.

##  Background

Originally, I practiced and saved files from **Class 22 to Class 54** during my JavaScript learning sessions.  
Unfortunately, due to a **PC fault**, some early files were deleted and only the **recoverable classes (from Class 22 onward)** could be restored.

After learning GitHub, I uploaded all the recovered files here to **preserve my JavaScript learning journey permanently**.  
This repository serves as both a **record of my progress** and a **reference for others** learning similar concepts.
